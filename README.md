# Problem Set 2 - Random Walks with OOP: from MITx 6.00.2x

In this project, we demonstrate random walks by simulating a roomba vacuum cleaner moving across a tile floor.

Uncomment line 285 before running to get a graphical visualization of the robot(s) cleaning the floor.

Notes on:
My code was added in ps2_working.py
The starting code is preserved in ps2.py
ps2_visualize.working.py was provided by MIT.
Disregard what's in the .ipynb_checkpoints folder
The file scratch_paper.py is exactly what it sounds like.
.pyc files were provided to support older versions of python.
